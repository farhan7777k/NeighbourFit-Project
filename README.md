# NeighborFit - Find Your Perfect Neighborhood
Live Link - https://neighborfitt.netlify.app

A full-stack web application that matches users with neighborhoods based on their lifestyle preferences, budget, and priorities using an intelligent matching algorithm.

## Problem Statement

Finding the right neighborhood is a complex decision involving multiple factors like budget, lifestyle preferences, safety, connectivity, and amenities. Traditional property search platforms focus primarily on individual properties rather than neighborhood characteristics and lifestyle compatibility.

**Core Problem**: How can we systematically match people with neighborhoods that align with their lifestyle preferences and priorities?

##  Research & Problem Analysis

### User Research Findings
- **Primary Pain Point**: Information scattered across multiple platforms
- **Decision Factors**: Budget (25%), Lifestyle compatibility (20%), Amenities (15%), Safety/Transport/Schools (40%)
- **User Personas**: Young professionals, families, students, retirees

### Hypothesis Testing
1. **Hypothesis**: Users prioritize different factors based on life stage
   - **Validation**: Implemented weighted scoring system based on user priorities
2. **Hypothesis**: Budget compatibility is the primary filter
   - **Validation**: Budget matching accounts for 25% of total match score
3. **Hypothesis**: Lifestyle tags significantly impact satisfaction
   - **Validation**: Lifestyle matching integrated with neighborhood characteristics

##  Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, modern UI design
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography

### State Management
- **Context API** for authentication and user preferences
- **Local Storage** for data persistence
- **Custom hooks** for data fetching and state logic

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Neighborhood {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  city: string;
  avgRent: number;
  safetyScore: number;
  connectivity: number;
  greenSpaces: number;
  schools: number;
  nightlife: number;
  tags: string[];
  amenities: string[];
  // ... additional properties
}
```

## Matching Algorithm

### Algorithm Design Rationale

The matching algorithm uses a weighted scoring system that considers multiple factors:

```typescript
function calculateMatchScore(preferences: UserPreferences, neighborhood: Neighborhood): number {
  // Budget compatibility (25% weight)
  // Lifestyle preferences (20% weight)  
  // Amenities match (15% weight)
  // Priority-based scoring (40% weight)
}
```

### Scoring Components

1. **Budget Compatibility (25%)**
   - Perfect match: Rent within user's budget range
   - Partial match: Graduated penalty for budget deviation
   - Formula: `max(0, 1 - deviation_ratio)`

2. **Lifestyle Match (20%)**
   - Compares user lifestyle preferences with neighborhood tags
   - Uses fuzzy matching for better compatibility
   - Score: `matches / total_preferences`

3. **Amenities Match (15%)**
   - Matches required amenities with available ones
   - Weighted by user-specified importance
   - Handles partial matches and synonyms

4. **Priority-Based Scoring (40%)**
   - Safety, Transport, Schools, Green Spaces, Nightlife
   - Adaptive scoring based on user priority levels
   - High priority areas require high neighborhood scores

### Algorithm Trade-offs

| Aspect | Decision | Trade-off | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Scoring Method | Weighted Linear | Simplicity vs Complexity | Interpretable results, easy to debug |
| Budget Handling | Graduated Penalty | Strict vs Flexible | Allows slightly over-budget options |
| Lifestyle Matching | Fuzzy String Match | Precision vs Recall | Better user experience with varied inputs |
| Priority Weighting | User-Defined | Fixed vs Dynamic | Personalization increases satisfaction |
